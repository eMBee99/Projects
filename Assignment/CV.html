        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I have an established and growing passion for technology, seeing me build my first desktop computer at the age of 14. I have a great interest in understanding how things work and enjoy the challenge of fixing broken technology. This passion has led to recent experience in audio and visual presentation for conferences and lectures.  
            In and out of education I have learned to code, specifically in Visual Basic, and I look to build on this understanding by learning Python. In my education, studying computer science at A Level, I was exposed to HTML and CSS, which has provided me with a foundation in web development. I became the go to guy among family and friends to fix their technology issues and install new devices.  
            My passion for technology led me to work experience with Phase 4 in Harrogate, where my understanding of how to troubleshoot computers was deepened, both in the hardware and software areas.  </p>
        <p> In the past couple of years, I have gained experience in the following areas: 
            <ul> 
                <li> Physical Computer Maintenance - including the installation of new hardware (RAM, CPU, PSU, GPU) </li>
                <li> Computer Software Installation and Maintenance </li>
                <li> Microsoft Office 365 Suite </li>
                <li> Network Installation & Setup - Specifically WIFI and Local Area Networks </li>
                <li> Visual Presentation - Using ProPresenter for conferences </li>
                <li> Conference Audio - In control of 32 channel desk, mixing for bands and speakers.  Additionally, responsible for recording lectures.  </li>
                <li> Lighting - The setup and console use for conferences.  </li>
                <li> TV and Sky/Virgin Installation and Use.  </li>
                <li> Database Creation & Maintenance - Microsoft Access & Excel.  </li>
            </ul>
            I have a give it a go attitude, with an appetite to learn and understand. I enjoy problem solving, always attempting to solve an issue no matter the size. I give my everything to the task at hand and believe one of my strongest characteristics is integrity.  </p>
        <p>I enjoy playing music, resulting in teaching myself the guitar and piano to intermediate standards. Since learning to drive in 2018, maintaining my car has become one of my hobbies. You can also find me Reading and keeping active by going to the gym and playing sports such as football and tennis. </p>
