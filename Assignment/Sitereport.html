        <p>Before University I had briefly touched HTML before with the help of a ‘codecademy.com’. Admittedly I only spent one session using it, however I believe that this session helped me grasp the content of the Web Development module easier. </p>
        
        <p>Starting this module, we were creating basic html pages. Here I took it on board and did not struggle too much apart from the use of doctype. The online validator would repeatedly throw up that error. Next, we were introduced to the use of CSS. This was fun to play around customising all the elements on the page. There would be times where I would need to get my head around the use of selectors and which syntax to use. </p>
        
        <p>Throughout the whole term, I have struggled with using id tags with target selectors. I followed the lecture notes and the exercises however I could not get it to work. I ended up learning about checkboxes before we covered them in lecture, I used a checkbox with ‘opacity 0 ‘on top of the menu icon. This was my replacement method for a burger menu. Later on, during my assignment I ran into an issue with my method, whenever I would resize my web page the checkbox and menu icon would no longer be aligned. The meant that the method was not responsive and therefore an inefficient replacement. I sat down again to relearn how to use id tags and selectors, but this time something clicked. It may have been the fact I had more experience since I last tried to learn it so I could understand it this time. By learning this I was able to use the ‘anchor’ as the hitbox without the checkbox being needed, this was by far the more responsive method to use. </p>
        
        <p>Learning animations was fun, I was able to understand all of them individually however using them alongside selectors I would struggle. Similarly, with how I relearnt how to use id tags, after a while I started to understand how to use them as I gained experience in coding html. </p>
        
        <p>Being able to control versions of my code is really useful and helpful to separate developing areas. Throughout my assignment I did not use the branch function as much as I should have. To be honest I would get carried away with coding the pages all in one sitting that would forget to use a branch to show I could use branches. However, I did get into a good habit of committing my work as I went along with major or minor changes. </p>
        
        <p>I had already created a GitHub account before university so when it was introduced, I was able to understand it well. I was able to understand the use of Fork and pull request because of my previous use of the website. Where Fork was to create a copy of the project for my own client and the pull request would allow the user to request access to edit the code with corrections or progress. The owner would then be able to accept or decline to merge the changes in code. </p>
        
        <p>The weeks that followed introduced forms and more advances selectors. Learning to use forms was useful as they will have many uses in the future. I have not had any issues with using forms currently. During the development of my assignment I needed to select a certain element within a block of css, however this was before the lecture on advanced selectors. I researched the problem I had and found a website that explained the use for selectors.  Using this I was able to advance past my problem. When the lecture on selectors happened this then helped fill in any blanks in my understanding. </p>
