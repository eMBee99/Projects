        <h2>My Progress with Web Development</h2>
        <p>Before University I had briefly touched HTML before with the help of a ‘codecademy.com’. Admittedly I only spent one session using it, however I believe that this session helped me grasp the content of the Web Development module easier. </p>
        <p>Starting this module, we were creating basic html pages. Here I took it on board and did not struggle too much apart from the use of doctype. The online validator would repeatedly throw up that error. Next, we were introduced to the use of CSS. This was fun to play around customising all the elements on the page. There would be times where I would need to get my head around the use of selectors and which syntax to use. </p>
        <p>Throughout the whole term, I have struggled with using id tags with target selectors. I followed the lecture notes and the exercises however I could not get it to work. I ended up learning about checkboxes before we covered them in lecture, I used a checkbox with ‘opacity 0 ‘on top of the menu icon. This was my replacement method for a burger menu. Later on, during my assignment I ran into an issue with my method, whenever I would resize my web page the checkbox and menu icon would no longer be aligned. The meant that the method was not responsive and therefore an inefficient replacement. I sat down again to relearn how to use id tags and selectors, but this time something clicked. It may have been the fact I had more experience since I last tried to learn it so I could understand it this time. By learning this I was able to use the ‘anchor’ as the hitbox without the checkbox being needed, this was by far the more responsive method to use. </p>
        <p>Learning animations was fun, I was able to understand all of them individually however using them alongside selectors I would struggle. Similarly, with how I relearnt how to use id tags, after a while I started to understand how to use them as I gained experience in coding html. </p>
        <p>Being able to control versions of my code is really useful and helpful to separate developing areas. Throughout my assignment I did not use the branch function as much as I should have. To be honest I would get carried away with coding the pages all in one sitting that would forget to use a branch to show I could use branches. However, I did get into a good habit of committing my work as I went along with major or minor changes. </p>
        <p>I had already created a GitHub account before university so when it was introduced, I was able to understand it well. I was able to understand the use of Fork and pull request because of my previous use of the website. Where Fork was to create a copy of the project for my own client and the pull request would allow the user to request access to edit the code with corrections or progress. The owner would then be able to accept or decline to merge the changes in code. When I went home for Christmas, I used my laptop instead of my desktop. Because of this change, I was able to do exactly this and access my work from the online GitHub files.</p>
        <p>The weeks that followed introduced forms, more advances selectors and keyframe animations. Learning to use forms was useful as they will have many uses in the future. I have not had any issues with using forms currently.  </p>
        <p>During the development of my assignment, I needed to select a certain element within a block of CSS, however this was before the lecture on advanced selectors. I researched the problem I had and found a website that explained the use for selectors. (TechBrij, 2011) Using this I was able to advance past my problem. When the lecture on selectors happened this then helped fill in any blanks in my understanding. For A level I had actually created flash animations, so when I saw keyframe animations I originally thought we were looking at flash. The concept of using the keyframes to state the location of the CSS object was familiar with me. Because of that I was able to understand how it worked and implement it in future code.</p>

        <h2>My Progress with My Assignment</h2>
        <p>I started the assignment at the beginning of November and finshed the main bulk of requirements for the development of the web pages, during the first week of December. </p>
        <p>For the assignment, I started with the index page first. I first wanted to find a background image for the page, so I went online to source one. I knew that I wanted the whole assignment to be dark themed as its easier on the eyes and currently very popular. I found my background on the website ‘unsplashed’ (Rose, 2018). I decided to use this background for every page as well as to keep the dark theme. </p>
        <img src="images/screenshots/first_index_commit-desktop.png" alt="original index">
        <p>Now I had my background I wanted to create the title for the index page. I had an idea in my head with the title in the centre and the navigation would be surrounding the title. The index page does not use display grid for the body. This is because the image I had in my head, I didn’t want to have a columned structure but a more free layout . These navigation links would highlight yellow when hovered over, I chose yellow as it stands out clearly over a black background. The title would have a bold stand out font and size to be the main focus on the page.  I also wanted to create an extra navigation bar on the left hand side, but with the text on its side. When the navigation that surrounded the title were hovered over, they would draw a line to the navigation on the left hand side also. This was all easier said than done. The idea would have looked very nice however it was not a responsive design as the lines drawn would be slightly different as the window was resized each time. Also, when I started creating the navigation for the other pages, there would be a clear difference with the positioning of the navigation. <img src="images/screenshots/checkbox-not-lined-up.PNG" alt="bad checkbox code"> This may have just been bad code, but I ended up deciding just to change the whole navigation entirely. The index page still stayed the same apart from the navigation to the left and how it drew a line on hover. </p>
        <img src="images/screenshots/cv-page-format for columns.PNG" alt="cv columns">
        <p>I then moved onto the CV page. I originally did not know how to present the page for a cv, so I googled examples (Barron, 2020). Once I had a plan, I started by using display grid for the body. I ended up using this for every page but the index, this is because I wanted the same formatting for these pages so it was structured. Then I created the sections that hosts the information and positioned them in columns. I already had an up to date CV, so I was able to copy and paste it over into a html format. </p>
        <img src="images/screenshots/portfolio-tiles.PNG" alt="portfolio-tiles">
        <p>After my cv page, I worked on the portfolio page. Here I wanted to create tiles for each of the modules. The original idea was to have a full screen button for each of the sections. However, I got it to work for one, but I realised I could not use the same code for the other 5 as it was just enlarging the section mentioned last as it reads top to bottom. So, I would have to create a new full screen button for each section, and I thought that my code would be messy and inefficient. I knew that there would eb an easier method, but we had not yet learnt it yet, so I decided to remove the code and wait until taught a more professional way to implement this. Now that I had all of the module sections I could add the placeholder images. </p>
        <img src="images/screenshots/new_nav_bar-desktop.png" alt="desktop nav bar">
        <img src="images/screenshots/new-nav-bar-mobile.PNG" alt="mobile nav bar">
        <p>For the navigation bar, I decided I would create it in its own branch and merge it later. I went with the traditional top of the page banner styled navigation bar. Each link would be spaced out with the use of display grid, I would set the 5 links to 20% columns. The navigation would still change colour with a hover over just like the title page navigation links did. When the option is hovered over the other options become less visible to help make the yellow option stand out even more. I wanted the navigation bar to be fixed at the top of the page, so I positioned it as fixed. I liked this navigation bar, so I merged it to every page but the index as it already had its own dramatic navigation to show off the home page. As I didn’t use it for the index page I had to use display none so that it was hidden in desktop mode. This is because I had to have the navigation in the html so it would work for the mobile version. </p>
        <img src="images/screenshots/contact-form.PNG" alt="contact-form">
        <p>Next was the contact page. Here I continued the use of sections in columns. I added some contact details on the left and on the right, I created a text area form to imitate writing an email to me. </p>
        <p>Lastly is the report page. I created the basics to structure the page. With display grid and a section for the text. However, as I am writing this report I had still to add content to this page. 
            Once I added the content to the page, I then arranged the content in a dated format with relevant sections, headings and dates.</p>
        <p>For the mobile versions of the websites, I created a separate CSS files for each page. In these files I copied over from the desktop version the essential blocks of code, for example the background and grid structure. I then made sure that the html pages specified the difference for the desktop CSS and the mobile CSS. For the mobile pages I had to use display none for the index page to hide the desktop navigation that surrounded the title. Once they were not displayed, I could then implement the other pages navigation bar. However, this time I would transform: translate it on the Y axis out of the displayed screen. I then created a triangle shape (Coyier, 2020) pointing down as I did not want a burger icon. Just my preference. This triangle would act as the traditional burger menu where clicking on the <a> tag would reveal and hide the menu. I wanted the arrow to move down and rotate 180 degrees so that it would end up pointing up so it would look like you pulled it down and then pushed it back up. It would then move up and rotate again to the default position.
            I added this navigation bar to all of the pages with the same structure. The other pages would have the navigation bar for both desktop and mobile except that the mobile was a drop down burger menu. </p>
        <img src="images/Screenshots/new_font.PNG" alt="new font">
        <p>Once I was done with every page, I wanted to look for a font that I liked for each page bu the index. When I found one that I wanted, I was able to implement it into the website pages. </p>
